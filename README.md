# PasswordGenerator
Pretty straight forward, I'd guess

This code is a solution to my lack of a password generator when setting up new accounts for projects. It is a simple applet made using the alphanumeric.substring(int, int) function. The code allows for int-length passwords consisting of lower/uppercase letters and numbers to be generated (which, if memory serves correctly is 32,767 characters max). There is also a checkbox which allows passwords with special characters to be generated.
